# SkMuscMediator
Profiling manuscript reporting expression values of Mediator complex proteins/RNA in skeletal muscle.

The code reported in this repository was used to analyze bulk and snRNA-Seq data. This data was used to report expression levels of Mediator Complex protein transcripts in different situations of skeletal muscle (aging, disease, injury, etc.). 

BulkRNASeqPipeline.sh contains the general workthrough of the injury and C2C12 differentiation datasets.
GSE156498.r contains the workthrough of the D51/DMD dataset
GSE211545.R contains the workthrough of the hindlimb muscle development dataset
